üîß Assumptions
---------------------
The following assumptions were made during development:

User Authentication: Users must register and login to access the application
Task Ownership: Each task belongs to a specific user and is private to that user
Data Persistence: All data is stored in a persistent database (not local storage)
Browser Support: Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Internet Connection: Application requires internet connection for full functionality
Mobile Responsiveness: Application should work on screen sizes from 320px to 1920px
Data Validation: All user inputs are validated on both client and server side
Security: Passwords are hashed and stored securely, JWT tokens expire after 7 days
Performance: Application should load within 3 seconds on standard broadband connection
Scalability: Backend API can handle up to 1000 concurrent users
